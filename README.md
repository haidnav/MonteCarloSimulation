# Monte Carlo Simulation: Asset Price Prediction

![Demo Monte Carlo Simulated graph](https://github.com/haidnav/MonteCarloSimulation/blob/main/demo.png)

## Overview
This project is a Monte Carlo simulation tool that predicts future asset prices using a simplified version of the geometric Brownian motion model. It's designed to provide a practical demonstration of the Monte Carlo method and its application in financial modeling.

The app allows users to input various parameters such as the initial asset price, annualised rate of return, annualised volatility, time horizon, number of time steps, and the number of simulations. After inputting these parameters, users can visualise the simulated asset price paths and export the results to a CSV file.

## Features
**Real-Time Simulation:** The app provides real-time updates of the asset price simulation as users adjust input parameters, allowing for interactive exploration.

**Interactive Visualization:** Users can visualize multiple asset price paths to gain insights into potential future outcomes.

**CSV Export:** Simulated asset prices can be exported to a CSV file for further analysis or record-keeping.

**Error Handling:** Input validation and error handling ensure that user inputs are within reasonable ranges and formats.

**Backtesting:** Users can input past data to test accuracy of the model. Please note that due to the use of a simplified version of the geometric Brownian motion model, this app will likely not provide the best results for real time trading as it excludes a range of external factors, such as:

**External events:** e.g news 

**Assumptions:** The model assumes that asset returns are normally distributed, which may not hold in reality, especially during extreme market events.

**Lack of trading strategy:** Backtesting often involves implementing trading strategies based on historical data. The basic Monte Carlo model doesn't include trading rules or strategies. 

However, i do think that this app could serve as a good educational tool for users seeking to understand the fundamental principles of Monte Carlo simulations and how asset prices can be projected using simplified models.

## Usage
Install the required dependencies using **pip install -r requirements.txt**.

Run the app with Streamlit using **streamlit run app.py**.

Enter the desired input parameters and observe the real-time asset price simulation.

Click the "Export to CSV" button to save the simulated asset prices to a CSV file.

Dependencies
**Streamlit**
